      <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Game of Thrones started off incredibly strong. The first few seasons were bold, unpredictable, and emotionally intense. Characters like Arya, Tyrion, and Daenerys were brilliantly written, and the world-building was unmatched. I genuinely felt attached to the storyline and was always eager for the next episode.</p>
      <p>That said, the final season didn’t meet the expectations built over years. Many character arcs were rushed, and some endings felt unearned. Still, I can’t deny the impact this series had—it brought fantasy into the mainstream and gave us some of TV’s most iconic moments.</p>

    <section id="rating">
      <h2>Final Rating</h2>
      <p>I’d give <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> a strong <strong>8.5 out of 10</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐✨. Even though it stumbled at the end, the overall experience was unforgettable and groundbreaking.</p>
